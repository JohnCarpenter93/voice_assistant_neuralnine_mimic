# voice_assistant_neuralnine_mimic

This script can be a bit of a pain in the rear end. He's just a little socially awkward so don't hold it against him. He probably means well.

To get it running:

-> Clone the script
-> Install all dependencies
----> tensorflow
----> neuralintents
----> speechrecognition
----> pyttsx3
----> nltk
-> Run main.py
-> Wait until the mic symbol appears in the bottom right of your screen
-> Have a look through the intents.json file for ideas on what to say
